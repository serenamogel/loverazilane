The treasured musician was only 62 when he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">passed away from gastric cancer</a>, and his loss will leave a hole in country music for a long time.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Following Keith’s death, the Oklahoma native’s fan have been flocking to his music to find comfort. He put out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">28 albums in total</a> over the course of a three-decade career, and each of them are wonderful reminders of Keith’s talent and unabashed patriotism. He touts his American identity loud and proud across his myriad releases, embracing that gun-toting, flag waving brand of national pride he made part of his celebrity identity.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Many of his songs lean into that patriotism, along with other elements of Keith’s belief system. With so many of his songs angled so carefully into Keith’s beliefs, passions, and lifestyle choices, it seems impossible that anyone else could have written his songs, but its not uncommon for singers to lean on writing help while producing albums.</p><h2 id=h-did-anyone-else-write-toby-keith-s-songs data-injectable=false>Did anyone else write Toby Keith’s songs?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Toby Keith has a distinct style, tone, and voice across the vast majority of his releases. While some musicians are trying out brand new genres or vibes in their music —&nbsp;hello <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyoncé in her country era</a> — Keith stuck with his tried, true, red, white, and blue, and found massive success across his career. He was a near-instant sensation when he arrived on the music scene, and he put out enough hits over the years to number among country music’s wealthiest.</p><p data-characters=710 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>A bulk of those moneymaking releases were, in fact, penned by Keith himself, but there were plenty of exceptions. Its rough to think up enough songs for 28 albums worth of content, and Keith was known to tap longtime collaborator Walter Scott Emerick. Emerick is the songwriting talent behind a number of Keith’s biggest hits, including Number One hits like “I’m Just Talkin’ About Tonight,” “Beer for My Horses,” and “As Good as I Once Was.” He’s credited with collaborating on some of the biggest releases of Keith’s entire career, and you’ll additionally recognize his talent <a href=#>across several other country artists’</a> discographies.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>Keith did write a number of songs himself, and they’re easy to track down — just take a look at his 100% Songwriter album. The album released in late 2023, and contains 13 tracks, all of which were “written 100% by Toby Keith.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46doJ1lpKSvunnKnqCtoF2sv6rAxGafoqtdpMSvedKopaCrXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-month-with-apples-fusion-drive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Fusion Drive - A Month with Apple's Fusion Drive</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-jenna-sinatra-and-will-devane-break-up-jenna-sinatra-and-will-devane-relationship-status-698272-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Jenna Sinatra and Will Devane Break Up?
