style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span class=small_bold_red>Review of 60 Riverside Boulevard by</span> <span class=_big>Carter Horsley</span><p>The handsome, 40-story, Aldyn apartment building at 60 Riverside Boulevard at 63rd Street has 136 units.</p><p>It was completed in 2010 by the Extell Development, which also built the Avery and the Rushmore just to the north and the Ashley just to the south.&nbsp;</p><p>These buildings were designed by Costas Kondylis, who also designed all the buildings for Donald Trump to the north on Riverside Boulevard.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The 40-story Aldyn has many amenities, some balconies, many stunning vistas of the Hudson River and a shuttle service.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Unlike several of the buildings erected along Riverside Boulevard, the Aldyn is not twin-towered and is, in fact, asymmetrical with its tallest element on the south side of the tower.</p><p>Like all of the buildings on the boulevard, however, it is setback at about the 11th floor.</p><p>There are balconies on the southwest and northwest corners of the building.</p><p>Rental apartments are on floors 2 through 10.</p><h2>Amenities</h2><p>The building has a very large amenities basement with 40,000 square feet of space that it shares with the Ashley, a 23-story, 209-unit rental building just to the south.</p><p>That space includes a La Palestrina Fitness, Wellness and Spa Center, a 75-foot swimming pool, a 38-foot-high rock-climbing wall, squash courts, a bowling alley, a lounge, yoga, pilates and kinesis rooms, and a basketball court complete with a scoreboard.</p><p>The building also has a concierge, a doorman, a garage, an entertainment room with catering kitchen, a children’s indoor playground designed by Kidville, a lounge designed by Roman & Williams, a private landscaped court designed by Mathews Nielson, private storage, and a shuttle service.</p><h2>Apartments</h2><p>Kitchens have either teak or white lacquer cabinetry with integrated dish racks and paneled premium appliances from Smeg and Miele.</p><p>Bathrooms have double vanities, separate glass showers and teak wrapped master baths with deep soaking tubs.</p><p>Apartments 1101 to 1501 in the building’s northwest corner have a 16-foot-long entry foyer that leads to a 26-foot-long great room with an open kitchen and four bedrooms.</p><p>Apartments 1102 to 1502 in the building’s northeast corner have a 13-foot-long entry foyer that leads into a 26-foot-long great room with a pass-through kitchen and three bedrooms.</p><p>Apartments 1112 to 1612 in the building’s southeast corner have a 7-foot entry foyer that leads into a 25-foot-long great room with a kitchen with an island and three bedrooms.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Donald Trump sold the southern half of this Trump Place property in 2005 to the Carlyle Group and Extell Development.&nbsp;</p><p>Extell continued to use Costas Kondylis, who designed Trump’s buildings at this location, for its first few buildings just to the south of Trump’s, but hired Christian de Portzamparc to design its Riverside Center segment. Extell also commissioned Mr. Portzamparc for the design of its 1,004-foot-high mixed-use tower at 157 West 57th Street.</p><p>From September 21 to December 10, 2010, the Aldyn had a fashion showcase with a $25 admission fee that was a contribution to the CFDS Foundation, a charitable initiative of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, to benefit HIV/AIDS organizations and breast cancer research.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLXTsqmemZypxm%2BvzqZmp7GTZL%2BqwsSrqqKclWKxs3nWnqqtZZWjsW6t1Z5mraCVYq6tsNinZG9oXae2t7HRrKCdnV2XvLa4xK%2BYq5xfp7K3tcSwZm1vZmZ%2B</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marion-cotillard.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marion Cotillard movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./star-trek-iv-the-voyage-home-1986.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home movie review (1986)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
