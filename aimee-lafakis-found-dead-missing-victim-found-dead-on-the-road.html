The Barrow County Sheriff’s Office told detectives on Sunday that the body of a lady had been discovered on Drowning Creek Road in Gwinnett County. Authorities identified the body as that of Lafakis, a mother and grandmother.</p><p>Brandon Wineinger, her ex-boyfriend, was arrested Saturday morning on suspicion of kidnapping, hiding the death of another person, tampering with evidence, making false statements, and first-degree robbery. “Wineinger was interviewed at police headquarters and during the course of the interview made several statements that were proven to be false,” Brookhaven police said in a statement that only listed one of the allegations.</p><p>“Wineinger was interviewed at police headquarters and during the course of the interview made several statements that were proven to be false,” Brookhaven police said in a statement that only referenced his false statements and tampering with evidence charges. According to the publication, Gwinnett County investigators also interviewed Wineinger and charged him with a cover-up.</p><h4>Report of Investigation</h4><p>According to Atlanta News First, police detained him after interviewing multiple family members and others close to Lafakis. Lafakis was meant to have supper with her daughter Friday night, who went to her mother’s house when she didn’t show up or answer her phone. Lafakis’ car was visible to the daughter, but her mother was not present.</p><p>The woman’s daughters and granddaughter were her entire existence, according to her bereaved family. “She was very proud of them, and the bond they shared was unique and special.”</p><p>“They will make her proud and live the lives she has always desired for them.” Many people adored her, and her legacy will be the way she lived. “She was genuine, funny, loyal and simply a force of nature,” they continued. Authorities are currently investigating the cause of death and have stated that additional charges may be brought.</p><p>Wineinger appeared in court for the first time on Monday and is being held at the DeKalb County Jail. As of Tuesday morning, a GoFundMe site set up for Lafakis’ girls had garnered more than $9,000 in donations. “Aimee was tragically removed from the family.”</p><p>“Last weekend, Aimee was brutally removed from her daughter’s (SIC). The goal of this account is to assist her daughters during this trying time. Please allow all of Aimee’s love to be expressed via love and support for her girls,” her sister DeeAnn wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7wKKknp1doa6nrcqiqmaen6q7pXnDnpidZZ2ewLS1zaBkr6GTqbauecWorKecXZmyorCMqKVmrJiaerO7wJ1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kenny-mitchell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenny Mitchell</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-stories-of-pi-are-both-true.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The stories of &amp;quot;Pi&amp;quot; are both true | Far Flungers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
