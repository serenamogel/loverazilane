While the drinks were delicious, everyone had one question on their minds: “Where did the Most Interesting Man in the World go?”</p><p>For a decade, from 2006 to 2016, Dos Equis ads featured a suave, James Bond-esque figure who could do anything and only drank Dos Equis, of course. To this day, he’s still one of the most memorable figures from any advertising campaign, so why did they get rid of the Most Interesting Man in the World?</p><p>In real life, the iconic beer pitchman was played by actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan Goldsmith</a>. While he has had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a prolific acting career</a>, with roles on everything from Days of Our Lives to Dallas, he is probably best remembered for this beer campaign. And he doesn’t seem to mind the association. Not only does he still have “#stayinteresting” in his Instagram bio, he wrote a whole autobiography entitled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stay Interesting: I Don’t Always Tell Stories About My Life, but When I Do They’re True and Amazing</a>.</p><p>Despite the popularity of the campaign, Dos Equis ditched the most interesting man in the world, and I found out why directly from the Dos Equis team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-spokesperson-outgrew-the-brand>The Spokesperson Outgrew the Brand</h2><p>Everyone knew the Most Interesting Man in the World! What everyone didn’t know was that the Most Interesting Man was selling Dos Equis beer. The spokesman had outgrown the brand and was no longer serving the purpose he was designed to serve.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-metoo>#MeToo</h2><p>The cultural climate has changed greatly since the Most Interesting Man campaign launched in 2006. Especially on the heels of the #MeToo movement, an older, rich man draped in conventionally attractive younger women wasn’t necessarily the vibe anymore. While there was nothing inherently problematic about the Most Interesting Man in the World, the concept started to feel a little outdated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ranking_light-beer_header-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-light-beer-we-tasted-them-all-and-ranked-them-burp><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Light Beer: We Tasted Them All and Ranked Them *Burp*</a></h2><p>We sat down to 12 light beers and came out with six that are worth buying. Here are the six best light beers, ranked from good to incredible.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-change-happens>Change Happens</h2><p>The Most Interesting Man in the World had a good run, outlasting many brand spokespeople. But, by 2016, his time as the face of Dos Equis had run its natural course. It was time for them to move on to new advertising campaigns (after testing out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a younger replacement</a> for Goldsmith).</p><p>Don’t worry about Goldsmith, though. He’s still super successful. After leaving Dos Equis, he went on to snag a role in Mamma Mia 2: Here We Go Again! and to act in other commercials. He couldn’t seem to leave his alcohol spokesman roots behind. He went on to do ads for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Astral Tequila</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stella Artois</a>.</p><p>And does he still drink Dos Equis? He talked to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Esquire</a> in 2018 and told them that he still has “an affection for Dos Equis.” “…When it’s hot, and I reach for a beer, sure. And Heineken was always a beer that I enjoyed. I drink them both.”</p><h2>Subscribe</h2><p>Get all the top food rankings, new product reviews, and other grocery content delivered to your inbox every other week.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>By clicking submit you agree to our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYmr%2BmecOim2asmJp6rrvSrWSipqSav6a%2F06KloGWdlrtutc1mq6GdXay8s7jDZp6oZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./russell-brands-astounding-net-worth-revealed-amid-sexual-assault-allegations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Russell Brand net worth revealed amid a slew of sexual assault allegations</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./liza-koshy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Liza Koshy Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
