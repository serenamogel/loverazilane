With his croons, wails and screams, he turned songs like “Tutti Frutti” and “Long Tall Sally” into huge hits and influenced such bands as the Beatles.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born Richard Wayne Penniman on December 5, 1932, in Macon, Georgia, Little Richard was the third of 12 children. His father, Bud, was a stern man who made his living selling moonshine and didn’t do much to hide his disdain for his son’s early signs of homosexuality. At the age of 13 Richard was ordered to move out of the family home, and his relationship with his father was never repaired. When Richard was 19, his father was shot dead outside a local bar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The childhood that Richard did manage to have was largely shaped by the church. Two of his uncles, as well as his grandfather, were preachers, and Richard was involved with the church as much as anyone in his family, singing gospel and eventually learning to play the piano.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Upon moving out of his family’s home, Richard was taken in by a white family who owned a club in Macon, where Richard eventually began performing and honing his talent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1951 Richard caught his first major break when a performance at an Atlanta radio station yielded a record contract with RCA. But with a repertoire of mainly mild blues numbers that masked the searing vocals and piano that would come to define his rock music, Richard’s career failed to take off as he'd hoped it would.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Commercial Success</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1955 Richard hooked up with Specialty Records producer Art Rupe, who’d been hunting for a piano-pounding frontman to lead a group of musicians in New Orleans. In September, Richard stepped into the recording studio and pumped out “Tutti Frutti,” an instant Billboard hit that reached No. 17.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the next year and a half, the musician churned out several more rock hits, including “Long Tall Sally,” “Good Golly Miss Molly” and “Send Me Some Lovin’.” With his blood-pumping piano playing and suggestive lyrics, Little Richard, along with the likes of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/elvis-presley data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elvis Presley" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jerry-lee-lewis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jerry Lee Lewis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>, established rock as a real musical form and inspired others, most notably the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/how-the-beatles-formed data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Beatles class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Beatles</a>, to make a go of it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to his records, Little Richard appeared in several early rock films, such as Don’t Knock the Rock (1956), The Girl Can’t Help It (1957) and Mister Rock ‘n’ Roll (1957).</p><img alt="Little Richard" title="Little Richard" width=1364 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-541759785.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Galuschka/ullstein bild via Getty Images</span><p>Little Richard, December 1986</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Gospel Music and Return to Rock</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But as his success soared, Little Richard, fueled by his earlier connections to the church, saw his doubts about rock deepen. In 1957 he abruptly and publicly quit performing rock and committed himself to the ministry and recording gospel songs. He recorded his debut religious album, God Is Real, in 1959.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1964, following the Beatles’ recording of “Long Tall Sally,” Little Richard plunged back into rock music. Over the ensuing decades, Little Richard continued to perform and record; though the public response failed to match the enthusiasm that greeted his earlier success, his importance in the development of rock music has never been questioned.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Awards and Honors</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1986 Little Richard was one of the 10 original inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was a recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1993, and a year later the Rhythm & Blues Foundation honored him with its prestigious Pioneer Award.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In later years, the once-dynamic performer retreated from the concert stage. He fell ill during a show in Washington, D.C., during the summer of 2012. The following September, Little Richard suffered a heart attack. He described the incident to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/cee-lo-green data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cee Lo Green" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cee Lo Green</a> during an interview in Atlanta: "The other night, I didn’t know I was having a heart attack. I was coughing, and my right arm was aching.'</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The singer took baby aspirin, which his doctor credited with saving his life. The deeply religious music icon attributed his survival to a higher power: "Jesus had something for me. He brought me through."</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Little Richard's agent <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/music/llittle-richard-dies-at-87/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=confirmed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">confirmed</a> that the singer passed away on May 9, 2020, in Nashville, Tennessee from bone cancer.</p><ul data-node-id=33 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1932</li><li>Birth date: December 5, 1932</li><li>Birth State: Georgia</li><li>Birth City: Macon</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Known for his flamboyant performances, Little Richard's hit songs from the mid-1950s were defining moments in the development of rock ‘n’ roll.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Rock</li><li>Christianity</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li><li>Death Year: 2020</li><li>Death date: May 9, 2020</li><li>Death State: Tennessee</li><li>Death City: Nashville</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=36><ul data-node-id=38 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Little Richard Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/musicians/little-richard</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 9, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJoo6KspKGybr7InJ%2BaqpQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-andres-wikipedia-and-age-how-old-is-the-pianist.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Laura Andrs Wikipedia And Age: How Old Is The Pianist?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./randy-orton-tattoos-interesting-facts-wwe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Interesting Facts Behind Randy Orton's Tattoos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
