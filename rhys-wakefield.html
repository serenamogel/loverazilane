He looks after himself as his weight is <strong>75 kg</strong>. He has gained weight but at the same time, he doesn't have any fat on his body.</p><p>Wakefield's body and face are complimented by his gorgeous blonde shoulder-length hair and his contagious smile.

Despite his impressive body, he doesn't feel comfortable showing it on camera.</p><p>While doing the 2008 film <i>The Black Balloon</i>, he had to do some explicit scenes. He revealed it was the most uncomfortable thing to do, and it got him kind of scared when he was told about the scene.</p><p>Upon questioning about the scene, he said:</p><p>I'm the kind of guy that gets nervous being half-naked in my room, so considering there was a whole crew as well as randoms in their cars watching... yeah, I was pretty freaked out about it.</p><p><i><strong>&nbsp; Check Out </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more celebrity biographies</strong></i><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqufsqtdrK6sscWinKWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fletch-lives-1989.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fletch Lives movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1989)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chocolate-cookies-recipe-chocolate-glaze.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Chocolate Cookies with Chocolate Glaze</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
