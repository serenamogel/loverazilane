She was also Zach’s first choice for a one-on-one, where she met his family early on in the experience.</p><p>Her friendly personality and openness about being a mother surely made her stand out amongst the other women, however, Zach sent her home after feeling as if she was making <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the other contestants uncomfortable</a>.</p><p>With The Bachelor behind her, it seems as if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Nashville native</a> may not be through with the franchise completely, as she recently dished on potentially joining Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p>While no official air date for Season 8 of the spin-off series has been set, it can be assumed that the cast will film sometime this summer and the season will be aired in the fall.</p><p>When asked on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Click Bait with Bachelor Nation</a> podcast if she’d want to go on BIP, Christina replied, “I mean, never say never.”</p><p>“Hypothetically, if I had a ‘friend’ who was thinking about going, since you guys have all been, what’s some advice you would give me? What’s the best day bed there? Should I be calling dibs on one?” she joked.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-christina-mandrell-dishes-on-possibly-joining-bachelor-in-paradise>Christina Mandrell dishes on possibly joining Bachelor in Paradise</h2><p>Continuing the joke, host and former BIP castmate Jill Chin asked Christina what kind of partner this “friend” would be interested in.</p><p>“Yes, this friend is hypothetically me,” she admitted. “I don’t have a type per se. I think in my recent dating years, I have been so open-minded. I proved my own point with not knowing exactly what I want after getting married and divorced, so I have no expectations.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She then asked hosts Mari Pepin, Aaron Clancy, and Jill who they thought she’d be “cute” with.</p><p>Jill couldn’t help but tell Christina that she could see her with Tyler Norris, who she called a “cutie pie.” Jill and Tyler were both co-stars in Season 8 last year.</p><p>While Christina admitted that Tyler isn’t exactly her “type,” she said she would be open to exploring the connection — although she did show worry over scaring him away with her “loudness.”</p><p>Christina, whose mom is Irene Mandrell and aunt is Country Music Hall of Famer&nbsp;Barbara Mandrell, comes from a famous family already. So, there’s no doubting the fact that music is a huge part of her life, and with a daughter at home, she may just have to make sure her future partner can handle it all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-kind-of-partner-is-christina-looking-for-in-paradise>What kind of partner is Christina looking for in Paradise?</h2><p>As someone who has roots in the limelight and “queen energy” — as Aaron Clancy put it — Christina is simply looking for a relationship that feels equal.</p><p>“I’m in the South, and I’m over the whole toxic masculinity thing. If I go on a date and I ask the guy on a date, I’m gonna pay if I was the one who asked him on the date. I want an equal relationship,” she said.</p><p>Christina explained how she wants to “spoil” her man without him feeling like he has to do something in return.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She also said that she has her baby girl to take into account, so there are many more things to consider when choosing the right partner.</p><p>Stay tuned for more Bachelor in Paradise updates and whether or not Christina will be gracing the beaches of Mexico later this year.</p><p>Bachelor in Paradise is currently on hiatus on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5KWsKmxy6ipZqaRqbawuoywnKKfmKh6qrqMqKVmr5ikeqS00aKqraGelnqurc2dqZ6knGLAqbvUpZtmnJGpsm67zWaZmpuYmrmwvoyipWaokaeupbXSnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-tartar-sauce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Tartar Sauce, According to Taste Tests</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-burke-mitchell-meet-the-family-of-pirate-gold-of-adaks-cast-340454-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Burke Mitchell?
