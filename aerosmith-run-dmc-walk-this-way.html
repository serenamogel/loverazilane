The hype over Aerosmith — who had six platinum hits in the 1970s — had cooled down. While hip-hop and rap was finding its way, the genre was mostly self-contained — far away from the reaches of mainstream music.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">So when Aerosmith’s manager Tim Collins answered a phone call from hip-hop producer Rick Rubin, proposing a collaboration with rap group Run-DMC, Collins’ answer, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jul/04/walk-this-way-run-dmc-aerosmith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Guardian</a>, was, “What’s rap?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Indeed, the two groups were in as different stratospheres as could be. The Boston rock band — made up of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/steven-tyler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steven Tyler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steven Tyler</a>, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer and Brad Whitford — were bonafide music legends who had hit a rockstar midlife crisis, as their singles didn’t skyrocket the way they used to and substance abuse started infiltrating the band.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, the rap trio from Holis, Queens — which included Joseph Simmons (“Run”), Darry McDaniels (“DMC”) and Jason Mizell (“Jam Master Jay”) — rebranded themselves as Run-DMC in 1983 while they were still teens and they were intimately familiar with Aerosmith’s music. Mizell had been using Aerosmith’s 1975 hit “Walk This Way” between his decks and Run had rapped over the track since he was 12, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jul/04/walk-this-way-run-dmc-aerosmith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to The Guardian" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">according to The Guardian</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But it was the genius move to combine the two disparate groups that created one of the greatest genre-crossing hits — and arguably changed the face of American music forever.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rubin wanted a 'white rock song that can be turned into a rap song'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mixing up genres wasn’t a new concept for Rubin. He had <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/aerosmith-had-never-heard-of-run-dmc-the-path-to-the-groundbreaking-hit-walk-this-way/2019/02/03/d0fefb10-04b2-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="already sampled" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">already sampled</a> AC/DC’s riff from “Back in Black” for the Beastie Boys’ Def Jam debut “Rock Hard.” Even though he was technically finished with Run-DMC’s Raising Hell album in 1986, he still felt like it was missing something, according to Geoff Edgers’ 2019 book Walk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith and the Song that Changed America Forever.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He felt he needed a tool — a secret weapon of sorts — to take the rap group out of its underground scene and propel them to mainstream success so that others could understand how nuanced and intelligent the genre is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I was looking for a way to bridge that gap in the story of finding a piece of music that was familiar and already hip-hop friendly so that on the hip-hop side it would make sense and on the non-hip-hop side you’d see it wasn’t so far away,” Rubin <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/aerosmith-had-never-heard-of-run-dmc-the-path-to-the-groundbreaking-hit-walk-this-way/2019/02/03/d0fefb10-04b2-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>. So he called up Tim Sommer who used to be a NYU radio jockey with a very specific request: “I need a white rock song that can be turned into a rap song.” And that’s when the idea of “Walk This Way” came up.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A magazine editor claims she introduced Aerosmith to Run-DMC's music</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While they did brainstorm using the track on a phone call, another account came from former Spin magazine editor Sue Cummings who said she had been covering a profile on Run-DMC when she had a thought sparked by Run’s riff of “Walk This Way.”<br tml-linebreak=true></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I wondered what a bunch of aging classic rockers would make of this recognition by a new generation,” Cummings — who once dated Sommer — wrote in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.spin.com/2010/05/25-moments-rocked-our-world/07_run-dmc-areosmith-horizontal/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Spin class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Spin</a> in April 1986. “Aerosmith were just out of rehab and their last album, Done With Mirrors, was flagging. Maybe an association with a young group in a hot new genre would freshen their image.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She happened to be going to Boston to interview Aerosmith, so she dialed up Rubin and asked for a tape of Run-DMC to bring along. “When I met up with the band, I proposed the collaboration,” she wrote. “Aerosmith had never heard of Run-DMC when I handed them that cassette, but they were willing to take the risk of working with a new artist.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While the accounts are jarringly different, Cummings suggested years later that both sides could be right since she talked so often to Sommer and Rubin. “I don’t dispute that Tim suggested it to him, but I suggested it to him too. It might have been that Tim and I thought of it,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/aerosmith-had-never-heard-of-run-dmc-the-path-to-the-groundbreaking-hit-walk-this-way/2019/02/03/d0fefb10-04b2-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she said in the book" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she said in the book</a>.</p><img alt='Steven Tyler, Joseph "Rev Run" Simmons, Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell and Joe Perry' title='Steven Tyler, Joseph "Rev Run" Simmons, Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell and Joe Perry' width=3000 height=2103 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-75553834.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage</span><p>Steven Tyler, Joseph "Rev Run" Simmons, Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell and Joe Perry, 1999</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">While Tyler 'loved rap,' Perry wasn't too familiar with the genre</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Next came the step of actually bringing the bands together, so Rubin started by reaching out to John Kalodner at Geffen Records, Aerosmith’s label. The band had released its first album after reuniting in 1985 called Done with Mirrors — and it was treading waters. So he took a chance on the meeting with Rubin… who was so young that he was running his label from his dorm room.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It looked like a bum slept there, and here’s this guy who looks like some young schlub,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/aerosmith-had-never-heard-of-run-dmc-the-path-to-the-groundbreaking-hit-walk-this-way/2019/02/03/d0fefb10-04b2-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kalodner said in the book" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kalodner said in the book</a>. “Except he spoke so clearly and he had such a clear vision of what he wanted to do.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Then came the call to Collins. After getting him on board, it was time to approach the band members.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tyler was immediately excited according to the book: “I loved rap… I used to go looking for drugs on Ninth Avenue and I would go over to Midtown or Downtown and there would be guys on the corner selling cassettes of their music. I’d give them a buck, two bucks, and that was the beginning of me noticing what was going on in New York at the time.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Perry knew less about the genre and it was his then 13-year-old stepson Aaron who schooled him. “I was so into rap,” the son of Perry’s wife Billie Paulette Montgomery <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/aerosmith-had-never-heard-of-run-dmc-the-path-to-the-groundbreaking-hit-walk-this-way/2019/02/03/d0fefb10-04b2-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>. “I’ve always had an eclectic taste in music… I got turned on to a lot of college radio. That’s where I would hear Doug E. Fresh, the Sugarhill Gang, and that first Run-DMC album.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Only the two of them were needed for the re-recording of the song — and the collaboration was on.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Aerosmith was paid $8,000 for the one-day session</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">So on March 9, 1986, Tyler and Perry went to New York City’s Magic Ventures studio, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/02/aerosmith-run-dmc-and-story-behind-walk-way/582220/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="getting paid $8,000 for the day" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">getting paid $8,000 for the day</a>. Meanwhile, Run-DMC was more concerned about getting an overdue rental car back, so they had to work quickly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The meeting of the two worlds — and their assumptions about one another immediately grew clear. “Run and D and Jay were huddled in a corner, really intent on something. I go, ‘Joe, what are they doing?’” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jul/04/walk-this-way-run-dmc-aerosmith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tyler said in the book" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tyler said in the book</a>. “He says, ‘Probably smoking crack.’ Later we went over to the corner. They’d been eating lunch from McDonald’s.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The iconic beats of the song were familiar to everyone involved (although the members of Aerosmith <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/02/aerosmith-run-dmc-and-story-behind-walk-way/582220/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="still argue" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">still argue</a> about who came up with it). But the lyrics did cause some fundamental issues, with Run <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/02/aerosmith-run-dmc-and-story-behind-walk-way/582220/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="calling them" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">calling them</a> “hillbilly gibberish ...
