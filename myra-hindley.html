In partnership with Ian Brady, she committed the rapes and murders of five small children. Hindley's 17-year-old brother-in-law tipped off the police about her crimes. Hindley plead not guilty to all of the murders. She was found guilty of three murders and was jailed for life. She was never released and died in prison in 2002.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born on July 23, 1942, in Manchester, England, Hindley grew up with her grandmother. After the drowning death of a close male friend when she was 15, Hindley left school and converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1961, she met Ian Brady, a stock clerk who was recently released from prison. She fell in love with him and soon gave herself over to his total control.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Crimes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Testing her blind allegiance, Brady hatched plans of rape and murder. In July 1963, they claimed their first victim, Pauline Reade. Four months later, 12-year-old John Kilbride disappeared, never to be seen again. In June 1964, 12-year-old Keith Bennett followed. On the afternoon of Boxing Day, 1964, 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey disappeared from a local fairground.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Finally, in October 1965, police were alerted to the duo by Hindley's 17-year-old brother-in-law, David Smith. Smith had witnessed Brady killing 17-year-old Edward Evans with an axe, concealing his horror for fear of meeting a similar fate. Smith then went to the police with his story, including Brady having mentioned that more bodies were buried on Saddleworth Moor.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Trial and Sentence</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hindley and Brady were brought to trial on April 27, 1966, where they pleaded not guilty to the murders of Evans, Downey and Kilbride. Brady was found guilty of the murders of Downey, Kilbride and Evans, while Hindley was found guilty of the murders of Downey and Evans, and for harboring Brady, in the knowledge that he had killed Kilbride. They were both jailed for life.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Confession and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1970, Hindley severed all contact with Brady and, still professing her innocence, began a lifelong campaign to regain her freedom. In 1987, Hindley again became the center of media attention, with the public release of her full confession, in which she admitted her involvement in all five murders. Her subsequent applications for parole were denied. She died of respiratory failure on November 16, 2002.</p><ul data-node-id=15 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Myra Hindley</li><li>Birth Year: 1942</li><li>Birth date: July 23, 1942</li><li>Birth City: Manchester</li><li>Birth Country: England</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Myra Hindley was a serial killer of small children, murders she committed in partnership with boyfriend Ian Brady.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Crime and Terrorism</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Leo</li><li>Death Year: 2002</li><li>Death date: November 16, 2002</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.
