These indigenous people are known for being naturally gifted at long-distance running thanks to living within the mountain ranges of Urique, Chihuahua, in Mexico. Because of the geographical features of that region, basic transportation there is very often achieved on foot.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>The audience is quickly shown how every day involves traversing on foot, making running a marathon like second nature to Lorena.

But for all of its drama and emotions, viewers ultimately do see some signs of hope. It’s definitely a remarkable production, shooting on-location in the actual region in which the film is set and casting young actors who are from that same area. The finished product earned several award nominations and even won director Miranda de Pencier the Directors Guild of Canada award for Best Direction in a Feature Film in 2018.</p><h2 id=h-montford-the-chickasaw-rancher data-injectable=false>Montford: The Chickasaw Rancher</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=758 data-injectable=true>This historical drama was based on the life and times of the real Montford T.
