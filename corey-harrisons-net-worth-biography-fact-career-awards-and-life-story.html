Corey Harrison earned his net worth as a cast member of the History Channel show, Pawn Stars. From the age of nine, Corey started working in his grandfather’s pawnshop where he learned the ropes in record-breaking time. Today Harrison is a partner, with his dad and grandfather, of a pawnshop in Las Vegas called Gold and Silver Pawn. The TV reality series, Pawn Stars, turned three generations of the Harrison family and their humble store into big stars. The program first aired in the summer of 2009 and was an instant hit. It is currently one of the most popular shows on the channel and on cable in general. Amazingly, Pawn Stars pulls in over 3 million viewers every episode.</p><p>Harrison, also known as the “Big Hoss”, is known for his no nonsense approach to his work. Harrison is in charge of the store’s daily operations and their 30 employees.&nbsp;With his the relentless hard work and dedication, Harrison wants to be the boss one day. But things are not always smooth sailing for Harrison as he is often at loggerheads with his father and grandfather about his responsibilities as a manager and his judgement in sales, especially when it comes to his purchases of expensive items. From the popularity of the show, Harrison published his book, License to Pawn: Deals, Steals and Life at the Gold and Silver, in 2011. The book gives an in-your-face account of his childhood struggles and the overwhelming fame from the top-rated television show. Despite the overnight success and the launch of his book, Harrison conquered his biggest achievement yet, his weight. Following a gastric lap band in 2010, Harrison’s weight went down from 365 lbs to 249 lbs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmLyzsdhmn5qqop7AsLrSZqWerF2svLPAx2aZoqeXp66xtNhmnZqbpGKwor7EnqlmmaeWv6W%2FjJqlnWWcnrOmedKtpquxXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marvel-lovers-are-sharing-their-fancasts-for-the-mcus-fantastic-four.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marvel lovers are sharing their fancasts for the MCUs Fantastic Four</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./buster-douglas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Buster Douglas Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
