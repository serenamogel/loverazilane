The accuser also names MCA and Geffen Records as additional defendants having enabled the assaults.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, “Combs and Hall were very flirtatious and handsy with Jane Doe and her friend, offering them drinks throughout the night,” before the foursome retreated to Hall’s apartment, where “Jane Doe was offered more drinks and was coerced into having sex with Combs.”</p><p>After the alleged assault, the lawsuit continues, “Jane Doe laid in bed, shocked and traumatized. As she was in the process of getting dressed, Hall barged into the room, pinned her down and forced Jane Doe to have sex with him.” Hall is a member of R&B group Guy, which was credited as pioneering the “new jack swing” sound in the late 1980s and early ’90s.</p><p>Doe claims she fled the apartment and was later informed by her friend that she, too, was also allegedly coerced into sex with both men in a separate room.</p><p>Days later, Doe further alleges, an “irate” Combs came to her home and physically assaulted her, “choking Jane Doe to the point that she passed out.” The lawsuit claims Diddy was “searching for Jane Doe’s friend because he was worried that she would tell the girl he was with at the time what he and Hall had done to them.”</p><p>Reps for Combs and Hall did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.</p><p>Combs was named in two other bombshell lawsuits filed just before the end of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York state law which authorized a one-year period wherein alleged victims of sexual offenses that exceeded the statute of limitations could file civil lawsuits.</p><p>The <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>first of those lawsuits</a> against Combs came from his ex-girlfriend, <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>one-time R&B star</a> Cassie Ventura, who alleged the rapper and producer of rape, physical assault, and a car bombing. Combs’ lawyer Benjamin Brafman labeled the “offensive and outrageous” claims to be “blackmail.” Diddy and Cassie settled the case out of court a day later.</p><p>But then later this week, a second woman, Joi Dickerson-Neal, filed a lawsuit against Combs, <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>accusing him of drugging and raping her</a> when she was a college student in 1991 and distributing revenge porn of their encounter. <strong>“</strong>This last-minute lawsuit is an example of how a well-intentioned law can be turned on its head,” a spokesperson for Combs told The Daily Beast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfqLKiuoydoJ2cqWKwsLnBrGSappRiv6K6w5tkrKyRp3qirdGopWagkaG5bsDOqKJmrKWnu7R50ZqnoqaXYsSwucCnZKedp2K5osPSrqCtZZOhrqq50g%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-1320-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brittany Matthews Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-lipnicki-net-worth-157341.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Lipnicki Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
