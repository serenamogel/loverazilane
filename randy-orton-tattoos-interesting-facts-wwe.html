Teaming alongside Cody Rhodes, Seth Rollins, Sami Zayn, and Jey Uso, he played a pivotal role in defeating The Judgment Day and Drew McIntyre. It had been a return a year and a half in the making. Fans were elated when they got to see “The Viper” step back into the squared circle. Orton is a highly accomplished competitor and has put on classic matches. In addition, he has some of the most recognizable tattoos in WWE history. Let’s take a closer look at Orton’s famous pieces.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to throw a rock in a wrestling locker room and not hit someone <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">boasting a lot of tattoos</a>. Just like pro athletes, wrestlers enjoy getting themselves inked up and showing it off. Samoan wrestlers, in particular, have a fondness for ink with intricate tribal patterns. Other wrestlers can be highlighted, like Jeff Hardy and Rey Mysterio's amazingly tattooed bodies.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/collage-maker-12-mar-2023-02-29-pm-3142.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Meanings Behind WWE Legend Dave Bautista's Tattoos</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Batista's range of tattoos now covers a significant part of his body, having acquired multiple new tattoos during his wrestling career.</span><p>Another major tattooed wrestler is <a href=#><strong>Randy Orton</strong></a>. Since his WWE debut in 2002, Orton has shown a fondness for some ink with patterns on his back and arms. It's grown over the years with his arms almost totally covered and a few other tattoos elsewhere. While some have personal meaning, a few are interesting in the stories behind them, including a surprising controversy. These are ten fascinating background stories involving Randy Orton's tattoos which add to his appeal as a WWE superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=randy-orton-39-s-arm-tattoos-took-hours><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Randy Orton's Arm Tattoos Took Hours</span></h2><h3 id=orton-39-s-most-iconic-tattoos-are-his-skulls>Orton's Most Iconic Tattoos Are His Skulls</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><strong>Randy Orton's skull tattoos took 50 hours to complete.</strong></li><li><strong>He touches them up each year.</strong></li><li><strong>Each touch up takes six hours.</strong></li></ul><p>Tattoo work can be a complex process, especially for the type Orton has.

That's not counting at least six hours of touch-up work per year, as Orton's ink is among the most complex in wrestling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=randy-orton-and-his-wife-have-matching-tattoos><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Randy Orton And His Wife Have Matching Tattoos</span></h2><h3 id=they-have-their-names-tattooed-on-each-other>They Have Their Names Tattooed On Each Other</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/orton-wife.jpg><ul><li><strong>Randy Orton and Kim Kessler married each other in 2015.</strong></li><li><strong>They have one daughter together.</strong></li><li><strong>Orton has a tattoo dedicated to her on his ribs.</strong></li></ul><p>Orton <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">and his wife Kim</a> are well known for their fun photos together online.

In his case, he was a huge fan of Bill Goldberg in 1998 to the point of going to an artist and asking him to replicate Goldberg's famous tribal art arm tattoo.</p><p>This <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">was against his mother's wishes</a>, and the artist refused, saying that wearing someone else's art wasn't a good idea. Orton is now happy he didn't get it as he prefers his more original tattoos over mimicking Goldberg's. He spoke about this on Ryan Satin's Out Of Character podcast:</p><p>"So Goldberg’s my guy and I’m an idiot [laughter]. So you know, the tattoo artist said ‘How about, let’s come up with something that’s just for you,’ So okay, that’s a good idea. And so you know, some version, one of this was born.

Orton just got it for fun while he was <a href=#>starting his career in OVW</a>.</p><p>However, Orton didn't realize that having a back tattoo and then wrestling right after it was a bad idea. He spent weeks with a nasty scab that simply wouldn't heal, so rather than looking cool, the tattoo caused Orton some early pain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>WWE Debut</strong></p></td><td><p>4/25/2002</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Notable Accomplishments</strong></p></td><td><p>WWE Champion, World Heavyweight Champion, WWE Intercontinental Champion, WWE United States Champion, World Tag Team Champion, Men's Money In The Bank Winner (2013), Royal Rumble Winner (2009, 2017), OVW Hardcore Champion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Notable Rivals</strong></p></td><td><p>John Cena, Edge, Triple H, Batista, The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Kofi Kingston, Daniel Bryan</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=the-tribal-art-covers-up-an-old-shame><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Tribal Art Covers Up An Old Shame</span></h2><h3 id=it-covers-up-a-marine-tattoo>It Covers Up A Marine Tattoo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/randy-orton-1-3.jpg><ul><li><strong>Orton had joined the Marines in 1998 after high school.</strong></li><li><strong>He was discharged after going AWOL and disobeying an officer.</strong></li><li><strong>He used to have a Marine tattoo on his left arm.</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He doesn't enjoy talking about it much, but <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Orton's military career ended poorly.</a> He had enlisted in the Marines and even got a USMC tattoo on his arm.
