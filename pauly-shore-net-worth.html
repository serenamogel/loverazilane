His 2014 mockumentary titled “Pauly Shore Stands Alone” won the award for Best Documentary at the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles. He has also hosted podcasts such as “Pauly Shore Podcast Show” and “Pauly Shore’s Random Rants.”</p><p>Shore comes from a family deeply rooted in comedy, as his parents owned West Hollywood’s famous Comedy Store since the early 1970s. After his mother’s passing in 2018, Pauly took over managing the club. Growing up surrounded by comedians had a profound influence on him, and he even performed his first stand-up set at a young age of 17.</p><p>One of Pauly Shore’s career breakthroughs came when he landed a job as an MTV VJ in 1989. He held this position until 1994 and became well-known for hosting shows like “MTV Spring Break” and appearing on the “MTV Video Music Awards.” MTV also gave him his own show called “Totally Pauly,” which ran for six years.</p><p>Apart from his work in television and film, Shore has released three comedy albums throughout his career.

In 1996, he purchased a 4,500 square foot home in the Hollywood Hills for $1.5 million. After renovating the property in 2015, he initially listed it for sale at $13 million but later decided to rent it out for $27,000 per month.
