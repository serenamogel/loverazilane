He not only stars in the show but also serves as its creator, producer, director and co-writer. Outside of his work on Atlanta, Glover is also a Grammy-Award winning rapper who goes by the stage name Childish Gambino, a stand-up comedian and DJ.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Donald McKinley Glover was born on September 25, 1983, at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Glover’s family moved to Georgia when he was still very young and was raised principally in the community of Stone Mountain, about 20 miles northeast of Atlanta. According to Glover, Stone Mountain at that time was primarily a white suburb and his family was one of the only African American families in the area.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Glover's father worked in a post office, and his mother was a day-care manager. Glover has a brother and a sister, and two adopted siblings. His parents, both Jehovah’s Witnesses, took in foster children for many years, and Glover describes a household that was at times chaotic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In high school, Glover became involved in musicals and plays. After high school, he attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and graduated in 2006 with a degree in dramatic writing. After graduation, he produced comedy videos with former classmates who formed a troupe called Derrick Comedy.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies and TV Shows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Glover has appeared in a variety of films, such as Magic Mike XXL (2015), The Martian (2015) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). But before he jumped onto the big screen, he was first a television writer, handpicked by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/tina-fey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tina Fey" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Tina Fey</a>. In 2006, Fey hired Glover to join the writing staff on her NBC series 30 Rock at the age of 23.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“He was literally still living in the NYU dorms,” Fey said. “And that was a great resource for us. We would turn to him and ask, ‘What would a young person say here?’”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Community'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Glover left 30 Rock after three seasons and decided to experience work as a TV actor, playing the role of ex-high school jock Troy Barnes in NBC's “Community.” After more than four seasons with Community, Glover decided to get the best of both worlds by developing and starring in Atlanta for FX.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">‘Atlanta’</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Beginning in 2016, Glover became known to fans as the star of Atlanta, about an Ivy League dropout who manages the up-and-coming rap career of a cousin. A hit with fans, Atlanta was nominated for six Emmy Awards following its first season. Glover was nominated for four of them and won two – Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series – the first African American to ever win an Emmy for comedy directing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Atlanta also won two Golden Globe awards and a Peabody award. The show was so well-received that FX signed Glover to a development and production deal in January 2017. Along with launching the second and then the third seasons of Atlanta, Glover also worked on an animated Deadpool series (featuring the Marvel Comics superhero named Deadpool) for the FX sister network, FXX.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In March 2018, it was announced that Glover and his younger brother and collaborator, Stephen, were leaving Deadpool over "creative differences." Addressing the rumors that he had too much on his plate, Glover tweeted, "For the record: I wasn't too busy to work on Deadpool." He also shared a spoof script in which the superhero reflects on the reasons the project may have fallen through, at one point asking, "Do you think they canceled the show because of racism?!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Underestimate Donald Glover at your own peril,” says FX President John Landgraf. “He’s remarkably multi-faceted. I look at Donald first and foremost as a creator, but also as an entrepreneur – someone who is almost boundaryless who can do almost anything [he sets his] mind to.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Solo: A Star Wars Story' and 'The Lion King'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2018 Glover enjoyed a prominent role in Solo: A Star Wars Story. The film traces the early life of intergalactic pilot and warrior Han Solo, the character first made famous by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/harrison-ford data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harrison Ford" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Harrison Ford</a>. In the new Solo movie, Glover plays the young Lando Calrissian, who was played originally by Billy Dee Williams in The Empire Strikes Back in 1980.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2019 Glover co-starred in the Amazon short film Guava Island, alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/rihanna data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Rihanna class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Rihanna</a>. That summer he headlined a CGI-animated remake of The Lion King as the voice of Simba. His castmates included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/beyonce-knowles data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Beyoncé class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Beyoncé</a> as Simba's love interest, Nala, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/seth-rogen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Seth Rogen" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Seth Rogen</a> as the dim but endearing warthog, Pumbaa.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Childish Gambino</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with his acclaimed work on Atlanta, Glover is a successful rapper who released his first three albums – Camp (2011), Because the Internet (2013) and Awaken My Love! (2016) – under the name Childish Gambino. The name was produced at random by the Wu-Tang Clan’s Name Generator.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Redbone'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After earning two Grammy nominations for the 2015 awards show, Childish Gambino was nominated for another five in 2018. This time, he was named the winner of Best Traditional R&B Performance, for<strong> "</strong>Redbone," and delivered a soulful performance of another Awaken My Love! track, "Terrified."</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'This Is America'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 2018 he released "This Is America," a hip-hop and gospel track, which Rolling Stone described as "a united front brought together by the constant threat of racially motivated violence." The music video shows Glover dancing frivolously with school children and then turning on a dime to commit random acts of violence. Receiving lots of media buzz, the track was Glover's darkest societal critique yet among his songs, expressing his view that America has become too distracted to realize the serious problems facing it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"This is America" went on to make history in February 2019 as the first hip-hop track to win Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the Grammys.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Donald Glover Presents'/'3.15.20'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reportedly seeking to spread some good vibes during the coronavirus outbreak, the artist in March 2020 released the surprise album Donald Glover Presents on his website. Notable for its presentation minus his usual Childish Gambino alter ego, the 12-track LP featured some previously released material and collaborations with top talents like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/ariana-grande data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ariana Grande" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Ariana Grande</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The album was abruptly pulled from his site after streaming in a continual loop for 12 hours, but it reappeared the following week on streaming services under the Childish Gambino name and with a new title, 3.15.20.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Glover and his longtime partner Michelle White have three sons: Legend (b. 2016), Drake (b. 2018) and Donald (b. 2020).</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=36 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Donald Glover</li><li>Birth Year: 1983</li><li>Birth date: September 25, 1983</li><li>Birth State: California</li><li>Birth City: Edwards Air Force Base</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Donald Glover is the star and creator of the television comedy 'Atlanta' and also raps under the name Childish Gambino.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Libra</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>New York Univerity, Tisch School of the Arts</li></ul><li>Nacionalities</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=39><ul data-node-id=41 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Donald Glover Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/donald-glover</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: November 6, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: November 25, 2017</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwsM6nmKWcXZy5sMLEqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-walton.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Walton Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bethalyn-staples-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bethalyn Staples Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
