What starts off as a catchy, guitar-driven piece gradually builds into a powerful, heart-wrenching tribute to the people we’ve lost. In this article, we’ll dive into the layers of “Not Now” and the meaning behind its lyrics.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Verse_1_The_Pain_of_Losing_Someone></span>Verse 1: The Pain of Losing Someone<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The song opens with the lyrics, “Come here, please hold my hand, Lord, now / Help me, I’m scared please show me how / To fight this, God has a master plan / And I guess, I’m in His demand.” The words capture the fear and helplessness of losing someone close to us.</p><p>As the verse progresses, DeLonge’s lyrics shift from despair to a plea for comfort: “Please save me, this time I cannot run / And I’ll see, you when this is done.” It’s a somber moment, but it’s also a reminder that even in the darkest times, we can still find hope.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chorus_A_Tribute_to_the_Deceased></span>Chorus: A Tribute to the Deceased<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The chorus of “Not Now” comes with a hard-hitting message. “Come on, come on, come on / Let’s keep it going / Clap your hands, everybody / Come on, come on, come on / Let’s keep it moving / Clap your hands, everybody,” DeLonge sings.</p><p>At first glance, the chorus can seem like a call to action, a way to keep moving forward even when life gets tough. However, as the song continues, it becomes clear that this is a tribute to those we’ve lost.</p><p>The second half of the chorus confirms this: “Well, I guess this is what it’s like when worlds collide / And don’t you know, it’s a beautiful thing / When two worlds collide.”</p><p>These lyrics paint a picture of a life cut short, of two people who never got the chance to see their worlds come together. It’s a reminder that although we may feel isolated or alone in our grief, we’re not the only ones who have experienced loss.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Verse_2_Finding_Peace></span>Verse 2: Finding Peace<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The second verse of “Not Now” is where we start to see a shift in tone. While the first verse was all about the pain and fear that comes with loss, the second verse is about finding peace.</p><p>“And I’m waiting, waiting for you to come home / And I’m waiting, waiting for you to come home / And I’m waiting, waiting for you to come home,” DeLonge sings. The repetition of these lyrics is haunting, but it also shows the undying love that we have for those we’ve lost.</p><p>The second half of the verse is particularly poignant: “And I’m scared, yes I’m scared / That I may never get out of here / But the sun is bursting, clouds are moving / We’re gonna get through to another day.”</p><p>There’s a sense of optimism that shows through these lyrics, a reminder that although our loved ones may be gone, we still have the power to keep going. And even when it feels like we may never escape our grief, the light will always shine through the darkness.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bridge_A_Final_Farewell></span>Bridge: A Final Farewell<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The final bridge of “Not Now” is perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire song. “Forgive our sins, we know not what we do / And we will please, please be with you / The pain is deep but words are few / Please lord, we’re asking you to heal,” DeLonge sings.</p><p>These lyrics are a final farewell to Casey Chaos and DeLonge’s father. They’re a plea for forgiveness and a request for peace. The intensity of DeLonge’s vocals, paired with the raw emotion of the lyrics, make it a difficult but beautiful moment.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=In_Conclusion></span>In Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Not Now” is a song that captures the pain of loss and the hope that comes with it. It’s a tribute to two people who impacted the lives of those around them, and a reminder that even in the darkest times, we can still find light.</p><p>Although blink-182 is often known for their catchy punk-pop anthems, “Not Now” shows that they’re capable of creating something much more profound. It’s a song that will stick with you long after it’s over, a reminder that we should cherish the people we have in our lives and honor the ones we’ve lost.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jq2fnmWdmq6vtc2gZJudmJ67pXnToZxmq5%2BjtG66zq1kp6enYq%2B6ecGloKejXWaFc3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-stories-of-pi-are-both-true.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The stories of &amp;quot;Pi&amp;quot; are both true | Far Flungers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./karina-smirnoffs-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Karina Smirnoffs net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
