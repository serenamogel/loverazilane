The idea behind MAFS is for couples to be married immediately and then spend a few weeks living together to determine whether they get along.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Evelyn and Jonathan frequently had tense exchanges and disagreements on numerous topics throughout her stay on the show. By the end of the season, they ultimately decided to be divorced.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Evelyn has continued to be active on social media since her time at MAFS and has looked for modeling and acting jobs.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Also Read:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Spoilers: Is Ruhma Carter Leaving Doctors?

It’s much more intriguing because of the tattoo on her tight.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>MAFS Evelyn Ellis Tattoo: Has She Removed them?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Some claim that Evelyn erased her tattoo due to her appearance on the show.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Regarding the removal of her thigh tattoo, nothing is known. She was spotted wearing a dress and showing off her thigh tattoo.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, we cannot conclude that she had her tattoos removed. However, she has a back scar resembling a laser tattoo.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Several claimed it was caused by gua sha treatment, frequently performed on the shoulders, back, and face. It can cause bruising on the skin that looks like this. Several others thought it was a scar from acne.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We will update this page once new information about her tattoo removal becomes available.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Evelyn Ellis Family Details</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Evelyn Ellis was born in Sydney, Australia, on December 12, 1995.

Evelyn became interested in modeling after college.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In January 2016, she began working as a Retail specialist at Harrods in London, United Kingdom, after completing her higher education.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She used to sell high-profile clients premium watches, personalized watch boxes, and aftercare services in Harrods.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This might be for various reasons, one of which could be that she didn’t want the media and paparazzi to intrude on her family’s private affairs.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She has, without a doubt, received support from her family during difficult times.
