You can use a wand to draw symbols or sigils in the air. They can be purchased or homemade.</p><p>Wands come in a variety of shapes and materials. Wood is the most traditional but metal, bone, and crystal are also used.</p><p>Wands have a long history and have been discovered in prehistoric burials and were used by Ancient Egyptian priests. The great Greek poet wrote about the gods and goddesses using wands to do various tasks.</p><h2><strong>How Do I Know Which Is The Right Wand For Me?</strong></h2><p>Many people like to pick out a wand in person. That way they can feel the wand’s energy. You want a wand that resonates with you.</p><p>In addition, the wand should feel like an extension of your hand. If you are shopping in person then pick up the wand. Move the wand through the air.</p><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Does it feel comfortable to hold?</p></li><li><p>Does it feel like a natural extension of your body?</p></li></ul><p>If you are shopping online which is very common you will need to know some details about the wand. This will give you an idea of the fit. Somewhat like shopping for clothes!</p><p>To get some sensory input go raid your kitchen utensil drawer. Stirring spoons, spatulas, and other kitchen cutlery can help you get a feel for size and weight.</p><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Look at the weight, material, and length of the wand.</p></li><li><p>If it was made by a magical crafter read their impressions.</p></li><li><p>Think about how you will use the wand - certain spell work, closing a circle,</p></li></ul><h2></h2><h2><strong>Wood Types</strong></h2><p>There is a connection between the wand and the wood. Woods have a natural feel and connection to nature.</p><p>What is your Celtic birth tree month? The Celts understood that different species of trees had different strengths and magical abilities. Read my blog on the <a href=#>Celtic Tree Months.</a></p><p>Trees have specific magical gifts that are imparted in the wood. Our ancestors connected with specific trees for different purposes. These magical gifts are imparted to the wand and this gives the wand certain characteristics.</p><p>You can <a href=#>read my article Tree Magic </a>in our blog.</p><h3>Wooden Wands Characteristics</h3><p>Alder - can be finicky which makes sense because it is associated with both fire and water. Bonds with empaths and those in helping fields- teachers, nurses, firefighters. A loyal wood. Connected with water and were often used for making boats. good vs evil, repelling evil spirits.

The wands are powerful for divination work, casting a circle, and healing.</p><p>Holly - the holly tree corresponds with protection against evil and bad luck. Wands work well with banishing spells. A holly wand is good for weather work and may work well with lightning.</p><p>Laurel - repel negativity</p><p>Maple - great for balance and grounding work. Maple is a good wood for money magic. It is also associated with beauty and harmony.</p><p>Oak - the <a href=#>powerful oak tree</a> gives wands that are good for all-purpose protection, inspiration, strength, and healing.</p><p>Rowan - the <a href=#>tree of knowledge</a>, wisdom, and protection.

Metal wands are often associated with strength and power.</p><p>Wand makers may also use metal within the wand or as a wrap to aid in its energy.</p><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Brass - associated with fire a wand of or containing brass works well with fire energy. Can be used to control fire and temperature, heal from burns, and works well for money spells.</p></li><li><p>Copper - great conductor of energy, helps to focus on intention, works well in spells intended to reveal deception or illuminate the truth.</p></li><li><p>Silver - connectivity, love spells, and protection</p></li><li><p>Steel - protection, strength, able to ward off evil spirits. is an alloy of iron. Iron was felt to keep fairies and negative spirits away from the home or barn. Steel became a metal associated with protection.</p></li></ul><p>Amazon carries a variety of wands some from small businesses. Obviously, any wand from Amazon would need to be properly cleansed. But a great way to get into spell work inexpensively.</p><h2><strong>Crystal Wands</strong></h2><p>Crystal wands are often used for healing and energy work. The crystal is matched to the wand and what the practitioner wants to use it for.</p><p>Crystals amplify and balance energy, as well as attract or repel certain emotions.</p><p>There are shorter wands that are one solid piece of crystal. In addition, practitioners often use crystals for tips or to decorate and add energy.</p><p>Crystals vary in their energy depending on what type it is. <a href=#>Read more about crystals</a> on my blog.</p><h2><strong>Bone Wand</strong></h2><p>Bone wands are traditionally associated with Druids and Shamen.</p><h2><strong>Length of The Wand</strong></h2><p>Some groups propose the length of the wand is important to its magical qualities.</p><p>In Wicca<strong>,</strong> some Grimoires or Books of Magic specify the length of the wand. When measuring for a wand measure the length of the magician’s arm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. An average length of a wand is 18 - 21 inches in length.</p><p>I feel that the length is not important. As we have discussed there is great value in the saying “the wand chooses the wizard”. And as we like to profuse here at CPH your path is very much your choice. So choose the wand that feels right.</p><h2><strong>Wand Tips</strong></h2><p>Tips of wands also play an important part in how the wand is used magically. They may also reflect the personal preference of the witch.</p><p>Pointed is probably the most common. Like a pointed finger, it directs energy where you want it to go. Associated with air.</p><p>Rounded tips diffuse energy. Air.</p><p>Spiral tips increase the flow of energy and are associated with fire.</p><p>Square or flat tips are used by witches who practice grounding and are earth-centered.</p><p>Crystal tips are used at the end of wands to add specific energy based on the crystal.</p><h2><strong>Wand Vs Athame</strong></h2><p>You can often do the same job with either an athame or a wand. Both can help you to create and distribute energy. Both can be used to cast a circle or invoke the elements.</p><p>Both can be associated with air or fire. Both work well for energy work or casting circles.</p><p>The athame is known to cut through illusion and seeks truth.</p><p>Wands are used more for spell work and has the intention of producing a result.</p><h2><strong>Will A Wand Make Me A Witch?</strong></h2><p>A wand is a tool that witches and other pagans use. Witches on Disney and HBO do not accurately represent the craft.</p><p>A magic wand will not give you instant powers. Instead, it helps you to harness your own</p><p>Abby of <a href=#>Willowroot Wands </a>says “wands do not shoot sparks, levitate objects, fly, or turn your family members into toads unless you have the powers to do that within you already. Real Magic isn't Flash-Bang-Zoom, it is quieter, more subtle, and harder to see coming, but it is amazing all the same.”</p><p><strong>Author, Imani Williams</strong> is a college student studying social work. She has been a kitchen/cosmos witch for five years. Imani is very interested in divination and spell casting.</p><a href=# class="summary-thumbnail-container sqs-gallery-image-container" data-title="Wands: How To Choose This Magical Tool" data-description><img data-image=https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/1679318252010-JNWGJ4B407JR1ZAPAHEP/Untitled%2Bdesign%2B-%2B2023-03-20T081619.549.jpg data-image-dimensions=940x528 data-image-focal-point=0.5,0.5 alt="Wands: How To Choose This Magical Tool" data-load=false elementtiming=summary-thumbnail-image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/1679318252010-JNWGJ4B407JR1ZAPAHEP/Untitled%2Bdesign%2B-%2B2023-03-20T081619.549.jpg></a><p>Wands are a ritual tool that helps you to direct your energy and focus on what you want to achieve.
