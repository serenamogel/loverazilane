While all of these songs are exceptional, we’re going to attempt to weed them down to just 10 of the best.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>If you’re a fan of Bob’s Burgers you’ll be familiar with these gems, if not here are 10 of the best Bob’s Burgers songs to jam out to when you’re feeling like a pick-me-up so get ready to shake those little burger buns!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The 10 best songs in Bob’s Burgers</h2><h3 id=h-you-ve-got-the-guts data-injectable=false>‘You’ve Got the Guts’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Bob’s Burgers has plenty of thanksgiving songs — enough so that they released an EP solely to celebrate the holiday. The most impressive of these has to be “You’ve Got the Guts”. When the kids craft their own Thanksgiving play, Tina lets her uniqueness shine by playing the lead role, the ‘Quirky Turkey’.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>In typical Bob’s Burgers fashion, the story of thanksgiving dinner is told in a hilarious and somewhat gruesome way. At its core, the song is about accepting who you are, and it’s accompanied by a banger instrumental soundtrack that ramps up to its rock-inspired climax.</p><h3 id=h-the-itty-bitty-ditty-committee-my-burger-buns data-injectable=false>The Itty Bitty Ditty Committee ‘My Burger Buns’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>While it may not appear in the show, the final track in The Bob’s Burgers Movie “My Burger Buns” might be the most catchy song by The Itty Bitty Ditty Committee yet.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>“My Burger Buns” has it all, a catchy chorus, the signature Bob’s Burgers charm, and even a throwback to the show’s theme song. The song is also one of the most produced tracks that the franchise has released yet which shouldn’t be too much of a surprise given it featured in the film.</p><h3 id=h-restaurant-on-fire data-injectable=false>‘Restaurant on Fire’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>The newest TV addition to this list, episode 6 of season eleven gave fans a song in four parts that are instantly catchy, hard-hitting, and capture the episode’s entire story perfectly. As it hasn’t yet been released as part of a soundtrack we don’t know the official name of this song, but “Restaurant on Fire” is a classic.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>After a fire starts in the restaurant, Gene, Tina, and Louise all come clean singing about their potential involvement in the incident. Ultimately it’s the song’s fourth singer Hugo the health inspector that sets everything into perspective.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Each of the verses in the episode includes the personality of the singer and it all comes together for a beautiful harmony to take the track home.</p><h3 id=h-lucky-ducks data-injectable=false>‘Lucky Ducks’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Another song from The Bob’s Burgers Movie, “Lucky Ducks” is an instant classic. Taking one of the most intense moments in the film and turning it into a musical is the perfect Bob’s Burgers way and this song executes this perfectly.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Featuring Louise alongside the Carnies who have never featured as prominently in a song before, this song brings something fresh while maintaining the same tone and high-quality fans have fallen in love with.</p><h3 id=h-happy-crappy-place data-injectable=false>‘Happy Crappy Place’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>While flawless production can make a song better, sometimes it’s the simple ones that steal your heart and this is why “Happy Crappy Place” makes our list. As we see the happy perspective of Bob alongside the angered voices of Linda and Louise, this song comes together to make something special.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>Originating from season five, episode 10, if you’re looking for some short, sweet, upbeat fun make sure to check this track out.</p><h3 id=h-sunny-side-up-summer data-injectable=false>‘Sunny Side Up Summer’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>Opening the Bob’s Burgers movie is one of the franchise’s best songs to date — and one of its longest. “Sunny Side Up Summer” is the perfect way to set the stage for what results in being a wild ride with the Belchers.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>The song includes some of the best singing performances from all of the main cast alongside a perfect instrumental. More importantly, the song gives fans all they need to know about where the characters are at in their lives to start the movie, and how could you forget when it’s this catchy.</p><h3 id=h-this-wedding-is-my-warzone data-injectable=false>‘This Wedding is My Warzone’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>If you’re looking for the perfect Bob’s Burgers romance song then “This Wedding is My Warzone” is a perfect choice. Nothing says I love you more than Bob speaking to his burgers on the grill — despite Linda’s harmonious warnings.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>The song premiered in episode 21 of season eight when Bob was tasked with catering a wedding. As you’d expect this didn’t go completely to plan, but at least the fans got this ballad from it.</p><h3 id=h-not-the-forgiving-type-the-fortress-is-the-worstest-nobody-s-getting-in data-injectable=false>‘Not the Forgiving Type’ / ‘The Fortress is the Worstest’ / ‘Nobody’s Getting In’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Yes, we know it’s cheating, but there was no way we couldn’t include all of the songs from season seven’s premiere “Flu-ouise” as they all come together to craft one of the best audio experiences Bob’s Burgers has had.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>As Louise suffers a fever dream her family attempt to help but instead wind up disfiguring her favorite toy Kuchi Kopi. This leads not only to Louise’s anger but also to a trippy fever dream starring her favorite toys.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>Things kick off with the song yet emotional opener “Not the Forgiving Type”. This is followed by a three-part banger called “That Fortress Is the Worstest” as her toy family encourages her not to head to the imaginary fortress. This is all capped off with two classics “Nobody’s Getting In” and “The Forgiving Type”.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>This collection of songs has everyone to love about Bob’s Burgers and while we suggest simply watching the episode to experience it as intended, listening to the tracks on the Bob’s Burgers album is a close second.</p><h3 id=h-electric-love data-injectable=false>‘Electric Love’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>Who would have thought you could turn the story of Thomas Edison and the death of his elephant Topsy into a love story.
