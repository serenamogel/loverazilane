It’s a career that if you want to accept, you have to put your nose to the grindstone whenever you’re working, put in a decent amount of education, and make sure your character remains healthy. The primary reason your character needs to be healthy is that you can only become a judge after you’ve reached an advanced age, roughly around when your character turns 50 or 60. Here’s what you need to know to become a Judge in BitLife</p><h2>How to get the Judge job</h2><p data-injection=true>Before becoming a Judge, you must have your character complete their education through high school and then learn about the law while attending University. This process takes four years for your character to complete University. After that, you must go through advanced education and attend law school.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to complete Judy the Judge Challenge in BitLife</a></p><p data-injection=true>After you’ve completed law school, you can now reach out to a law firm to work as a junior associate. You’ll want to remain at this law firm and work hard every year to become a partner with the establishment eventually. The primary goal you want to reach is to remain a lawyer for 30 years. Because you have to remain here for so long, you want to take care of your character’s health by working out, going on walks, meditating, creating good relationships with your co-workers, and monitoring your character’s diet.</p><p>Once you’ve reached 30 years of law experience, you can apply for the Magistrate position at a Municipal. You can only be accepted for this position after going through law school and gaining 30 years of experience as a lawyer. Attempting to go after this job before this time period won’t work.</p><p>You’ll need to work hard every year as a Magistrate, similar to when you were working at the law firm, and become good friends with your colleagues. Eventually, you’ll receive a promotion to become a judge.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
