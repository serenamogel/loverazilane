Early in his career, he wrote for Saturday Night Live and created the short-lived The Ben Stiller Show. After directing and starring in several movies, he earned widespread fame for the 1998 gross-out comedy There's Something About Mary. Stiller has since starred in Zoolander, as well as the successful Meet the Parents and Night at the Museum films.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller was born on November 30, 1965, in New York City, the second child of famed comedians Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. Raised on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, he attended the University of California at Los Angeles but left in 1984 after only nine months. He then made his acting debut in a Broadway revival of The House of Blue Leaves in 1985.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Saturday Night Live'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Two years later, Stiller made his big-screen debut in Fresh Horses, starring alongside aging Brat Pack members <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/molly-ringwald data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Molly Ringwald" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Molly Ringwald</a> and Andrew McCarthy. The fact that the film was a disaster didn't faze Stiller, whose next gig, in 1989, was as a writer for the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL). He described the backstage atmosphere there as "very negative" and, disillusioned, left for Los Angeles after just five weeks as an SNL writer.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">TV Shows and Films</h2><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Ben Stiller Show'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In Los Angeles, Stiller began work on The Ben Stiller Show, a half-hour sketch comedy that aired on MTV before being picked up by FOX for a brief run. Like Saturday Night Live during the 1970s and '80s, The Ben Stiller Show became a fertile breeding ground for young, hip comics, with Bob Odenkirk, Andy Dick and Janeane Garofalo among the talents who wrote or acted for the program. Despite positive critical reviews, the show was canceled after just 12 episodes, though Stiller and his co-writers did win an Emmy for outstanding writing in a variety or music program in 1993.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Reality Bites'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stiller's next project was directing and acting in Reality Bites (1994), a film about the issues plaguing a group of college graduates. Starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/winona-ryder data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Winona Ryder" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Winona Ryder</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ethan-hawke data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ethan Hawke" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ethan Hawke</a> and Garofalo, and often seen as a glorification of Generation X and the values commonly associated with it, Reality Bites was unpopular with critics but became a minor cult classic. Stiller then embarked on directing A Simple Plan, but six weeks into production he had a falling out with Savoy Pictures over budget issues and abandoned the picture.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Flirting with Disaster,' 'The Cable Guy'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stiller returned to the big screen in the David O. Russell comedy Flirting with Disaster (1996), playing a young father searching for his birth parents. He then directed and appeared in the offbeat comedy The Cable Guy (1996), which starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jim-carrey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jim Carrey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jim Carrey</a> and Matthew Broderick.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'There's Something About Mary'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was Stiller's starring role in the gross-out comedy There's Something about Mary (1998), alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/cameron-diaz data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cameron Diaz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cameron Diaz</a> and Matt Dillon, that propelled him to widespread fame. The following year, the comedian co-wrote the mock self-help book, Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction, with Garofalo.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Meet the Parents' and Sequels</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2000, Stiller appeared with Jenna Elfman and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/edward-norton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Edward Norton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Edward Norton</a> in Keeping the Faith and teamed with Hollywood veterans <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/robert-de-niro data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert De Niro" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert De Niro</a> and Blythe Danner for the sidesplitting comedy Meet the Parents. The film's success eventually led to the creation of two sequels, Meet the Fockers (2004) and Little Fockers (2010).</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Zoolander,' 'The Royal Tenenbaums'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2001, Stiller appeared in distinctly contrasting roles on the big screen: Zoolander, a satirical look at the fashion industry, was more of his typical goofy effort. However, he also showed a serious side as a fiercely protective father in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/wes-anderson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wes Anderson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Wes Anderson</a> comedy-drama The Royal Tenenbaums.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Starsky & Hutch,' 'Dodgeball,' 'Along Came Polly'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2004, Stiller teamed with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/owen-wilson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Owen Wilson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Owen Wilson</a> for an update of the classic TV action comedy Starsky & Hutch, and played Vince Vaughn's nemesis in the comic spoof Dodgeball. He also paired with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jennifer-aniston data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Aniston" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jennifer Aniston</a> for the romantic comedy Along Came Polly.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Night at the Museum' Franchise</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2006, Stiller channeled his brand of neurotic humor toward younger audiences for Night at the Museum. A huge hit, it spawned the sequels Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014).</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Tropic Thunder,' 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stiller directed and starred in Tropic Thunder (2008) and the remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013), drawing mixed reviews. During this period, he also appeared alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/eddie-murphy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eddie Murphy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eddie Murphy</a> in the comedy caper Tower Heist (2011), and reunited with Vaughn for The Watch (2012). The funnyman then reprised one of his most famous roles in 2016 with Zoolander 2.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Meyerowitz Stories,' 'Escape at Dannemora'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After starring in a pair of 2017 comedy-dramas, The Meyerowitz Stories and Brad's Status, Stiller resumed his focus on directing with the Emmy-nominated Escape at Dannemora (2018), a seven-part series based on the true story of an infamous 2015 prison breakout that sparked a massive manhunt.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 2000, Stiller married the actress Christine Taylor, who was known for her role as Marcia Brady in The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) and later starred in Zoolander. The couple had two children before announcing their split in 2017, though they continued to attend public events together, including the 2019 Emmy Awards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In October 2016, Stiller revealed on The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/howard-stern data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Howard Stern" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Howard Stern</a> Show that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer two years earlier, and that doctors were able to successfully treat the disease because of early detection. "It came out of the blue for me. I had no idea," Stiller told Stern. "At first, I didn't know what was gonna happen. I was scared. It just stopped everything in your life because you can't plan for a movie because you don't know what's gonna happen."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He said he went public with his diagnosis to raise awareness about early detection and the PSA or prostate-specific antigen test, which helps doctors screen for the disease. ”I wanted to talk about it because of the [PSA] test. ... I feel like the test saved my life," he said.</p><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Ben Stiller</li><li>Birth Year: 1965</li><li>Birth date: November 30, 1965</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: New York</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Actor and director Ben Stiller is responsible for such funny films as 'There's Something About Mary,' 'Zoolander' and 'Meet the Parents.'</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>University of California, Los Angeles</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=38><ul data-node-id=40 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Ben Stiller Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/ben-stiller</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 13, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwrsSnZKysmaG5pr4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karisse-37721.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Karisse | Page 4305 | Bulbagarden</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pressley-hosbach.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pressley Hosbach Biography, Age, Height, Wiki, Net Worth, TikTok Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
