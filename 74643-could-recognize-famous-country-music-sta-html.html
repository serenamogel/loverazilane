Apart from that, he is rarely seen nowadays without his cowboy hat.</p><p class=Eg>As <i class=Dg><a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.wideopencountry.com/chris-stapleton-without-beard/>Wide Open Country</a></i> reported, it was not like that all the time. When he started his career, he didn’t have such a long beard nor a cowboy hat. Five years ago, he took to <i class=Dg>Instagram </i>to share a throwback showing his previous face-shaved style.</p><p class=Eg>The photo showed three people wearing shirts and staring at the camera. One of them had a mustache, the one in the middle had a cowboy hat, and the third one didn’t have any.</p><p class=Eg>Stapleton captioned the image writing that one of those people was him. Even though he didn’t provide more clues, people identified him in no time. However, they admitted how different he looked without his beard.</p><p class=Eg>He later posted a different one that surprised his followers even more. It was a blurry image showing him holding a guitar next to another man. He captioned that one admitting that it was his first gig in Nashville.</p><p class=Eg>It took place on the sidewalk of 2nd avenue and he only played for one hour. He confessed that he made $20 and that it was the best hourly wage he had ever earned at that time. It was also the first time people noticed his talent.</p><p class=Eg>Many years later, his beard grew bigger and his music spread through the entire world. His first record was titled <i class=Dg>Traveller</i> and was released in 2015, two years after his father passed away.</p><p class=Eg>He revealed that most of the lyrics and songs of that album were inspired by a road trip he and his wife took through the Southwest after losing his father. When it came out, it was overshadowed by <i class=Dg>Crash and Burn</i>, a song that he wrote and sand on for Thomas Rhett.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnBrb2xjYrCwwcudZKudk6S0r7XZnmSfmZ2kwrR5wqisp6yirnquwdKimmarpJZ7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tabletop-rpg-fans-raise-over-100000-dollars-to-fight-ron-desantis-ongoing-transphobic-laws-in-florida.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tabletop RPG fans raise over $100,000 dollars to fight Ron DeSantis ongoing transphobic laws in F</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./227908-megan-thee-stallion-shares-her-makeup-ti-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Megan Thee Stallion Share Makeup Tips as She Uses a Blue &amp;amp; White Color Palette</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
