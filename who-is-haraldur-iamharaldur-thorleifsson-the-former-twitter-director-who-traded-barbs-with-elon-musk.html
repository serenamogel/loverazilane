Ueno worked for high-profile clients like Apple, ESPN, Facebook, Google, and The New York Times and won numerous design awards since it was founded in 2014. He has been recognized for his achievements in the design field several times throughout his own career, including being named the Person of the Year in his native Iceland.</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Thorliefsson graduated from the University of Iceland with a B. S. in finance and a B.A. in philosophy. In addition to pursuing design after graduating, he has dedicated much of his life to charity. Five years after creating Ueno, Thorliefsson started the non-profit, Bueno, with the mission to donate $1 million to good causes by the year 2029. Last year, the Iceland‚Äôs president honored Thorliefsson with the Order of the Falcon, the medal of merit for contributions to Icelandic social issues and humanity.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>As detailed in a Twitter thread, Thorliefsson has muscular dystrophy, a genetic condition that leads to a loss of muscle usage over time. By the age of 25, he was forced to use a wheelchair and now struggles to use his arms for long periods of time. In 2021, he created a project called Ramp Up Reykjavik in order to install more wheelchair ramps around the city to benefit wheelchair users. The project has since expanded to the entirety of the nation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>In other news, I'm opening a restaurant in downtown Reykjavik very soon.</p><p>It's named after my mom.
