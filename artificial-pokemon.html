It is rumored that it was first created when a <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Ball</a> was exposed to a powerful pulse of energy. This theory is supported further by the fact that its internal components are not a natural occurrence.</p><h3><span id=Porygon.2C_Porygon2.2C_and_Porygon-Z></span><span class=mw-headline id=Porygon,_Porygon2,_and_Porygon-Z>Porygon, Porygon2, and Porygon-Z</span></h3><p>Until the re-discovery of <a href=# title="Golett (Pokémon)">Golett</a>, <a href=# title="Porygon (Pokémon)">Porygon</a> was thought to be the first Pokémon created deliberately. It is the first Pokémon deliberately created using modern technology, as the result of an experiment by the <a href=# title="Cinnabar Lab">Cinnabar Lab</a> in <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a>. <a href=# title="Silph Co.">Silph Co.</a> possesses a report on the Pokémon, calling it the first "virtual-reality Pokémon." Because it is made up entirely of computer data, it can exist in cyberspace. According to some Pokédex entries, there is copy-protection data embedded in the program to prevent illegal reproduction, but because Porygon can be bred using <a href=# title="Ditto (Pokémon)">Ditto</a>, this is arguably ineffective. Porygon was developed to work in space, but it lacks this ability until evolving.</p><p>Porygon possesses two evolutions, both possible through artificial upgrades. <a href=# title="Porygon2 (Pokémon)">Porygon2</a> evolves from Porygon when it is traded while holding an <a href=# title=Upgrade>Upgrade</a>. According to some Pokédex entries, it is designed to work in and explore space; despite this, it is unable to reach and explore other planets. Unlike its predecessor, Porygon2 is not limited to what is contained in its program—it is capable of learning.</p><p>Porygon2 evolves into <a href=# title="Porygon-Z (Pokémon)">Porygon-Z</a> when traded holding a <a href=# title="Dubious Disc">Dubious Disc</a>. It is a modification of Porygon2, designed for travel between different <a href=# title=Dimension>dimensions</a>. However, it did not work as planned, so it exhibits erratic behavior.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Mewtwo>Mewtwo</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Mewtwo (Pokémon)">Mewtwo</a> is a powerful Legendary Pokémon, the result of gene-splicing experiments using the DNA of the <a href=# title="Mythical Pokémon">Mythical Pokémon</a> <a href=# title="Mew (Pokémon)">Mew</a>. According to logs found in the <a href=# title="Pokémon Mansion (Kanto)">Pokémon Mansion</a> in Kanto, Mew "gave birth" to Mewtwo after an embryo had been developed. This is inconsistent with Pokémon traditionally being born from <a href=# title="Pokémon Egg">Eggs</a>. It has a somewhat artificial appearance, most notably the tube protruding from the back of its neck. Like Mew, it harnesses powerful <a href=# title="Psychic (type)">psychic</a> energy. However, Mewtwo's power was amplified to exceed Mew's power to create the most powerful Pokémon in existence.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Baltoy_and_Claydol>Baltoy and Claydol</span></h3><p>Many of <a href=# title="Claydol (Pokémon)">Claydol</a>'s Pokédex entries state that it and its pre-evolution, <a href=# title="Baltoy (Pokémon)">Baltoy</a>, were originally clay figures created by ancient people. The figures came to life after being exposed to mystical rays.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Castform>Castform</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Castform (Pokémon)">Castform</a> was created by scientists at the <a href=# title="Weather Institute">Weather Institute</a> in <a href=# title=Hoenn>Hoenn</a> to help predict the <a href=# title=Weather>weather</a>. Because of this, it has the ability to <a href=# title="Forecast (Ability)">change</a> its <a href=# title=Form>form</a> and type with the weather.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Banette>Banette</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Banette (Pokémon)">Banette</a> is a plush doll that was thrown away and came to life due to its grudge over being disowned. It seeks the child who abandoned it. However, it is said that treating Banette nicely will satisfy it, causing it to turn back into a plush toy.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Trubbish_and_Garbodor>Trubbish and Garbodor</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Trubbish (Pokémon)">Trubbish</a>'s Pokédex entries say it was created when garbage and industrial waste mixed, causing a reaction that generated Trubbish. <a href=# title="Garbodor (Pokémon)">Garbodor</a>, as its evolution, springs from the same source.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Golett_and_Golurk>Golett and Golurk</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Golett (Pokémon)">Golett</a> and <a href=# title="Golurk (Pokémon)">Golurk</a> were apparently created by an ancient civilization to protect people and Pokémon alike.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Genesect>Genesect</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Genesect (Pokémon)">Genesect</a>, a Mythical Pokémon, was a different Pokémon many years ago. However, in <a href=# title=Unova>Unova</a>, <a href=# title="Team Plasma">Team Plasma</a> reconstructed it from a <a href=# title=Fossil>Fossil</a> to create the most powerful Pokémon ever. <a href=# title=N>N</a> cancelled the project due to his belief that a Pokémon modified by science would lose its pureness. <a href=# title="P2 Laboratory">One scientist</a>, however, kept working on the project in secrecy, disagreeing with N's decision to cancel it. The scientist equipped Genesect with a metallic body, a cannon behind its head, and items known as <a href=# title=Drive>drives</a> which change the type of its <a href=# title="Signature move">signature move</a>, <a href=# title="Techno Blast (move)">Techno Blast</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Type:_Null_and_Silvally>Type: Null and Silvally</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Type: Null (Pokémon)">Type: Null</a> was created by the <a href=# title="Aether Foundation">Aether Foundation</a> as part of its "Beast Killer" project - an initiative to create a Pokémon optimized for battling the <a href=# title="Ultra Beast">Ultra Beasts</a> by using cell cultures from all known types of Pokémon and combining their greatest strengths. Originally known as "Type: Full", the <a href=# title="RKS System (Ability)">RKS System</a> it was originally built with was intended to allow it to change types to adapt to any situation. When the three known models all rejected the RKS system and went berserk, the project was deemed a failure and they were placed into cryogenic stasis. The helmet Type: Null wears was made to stabilize the side-effects of the RKS System's rejection at the expense of suppressing its full power. When it evolves into <a href=# title="Silvally (Pokémon)">Silvally</a>, it deliberately destroys its helmet and becomes able to use the RKS System without losing control of itself. Silvally was named by <a href=# title=Gladion>Gladion</a>, according to the Pokédex. Additional Type: Null are later created in <a href=# title=Galar>Galar</a> using stolen research notes.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Magearna>Magearna</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Magearna (Pokémon)">Magearna</a> was created over 500 years ago by human hands.

As they were created from genetic waste, Grimer and Muk are <a href=# title="Poison (type)">Poison-type</a> Pokémon.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Deoxys>Deoxys</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Deoxys (Pokémon)">Deoxys</a> is said to be a virus that fell from space while attached to a meteor. Once on Earth, this virus was mutated by accidental exposure to a laser beam which transformed it into a Pokémon. Its DNA remains unstable and it will <a href=# title="List of Pokémon with form differences">mutate further</a> when exposed to certain sources of extraterrestrial radiation.</p><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Adventures">Pokémon Adventures</a>, <a href=# title="Deoxys (Adventures)">Deoxys</a> is one of two specimens.

Burmy's cloak will change depending on the location of its last battle.</p><p>A female Burmy with the Trash Cloak will evolve into Trash Cloak <a href=# title="Wormadam (Pokémon)">Wormadam</a>, with the same artificial cloak it had as a Burmy. Unlike with Burmy, however, Wormadam's cloak is permanent.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Spiritomb>Spiritomb</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Spiritomb (Pokémon)">Spiritomb</a> were once 108 separate entities whose sins caused their spirits to be bound together into the <a href=# title="Odd Keystone">Odd Keystone</a> as this Pokémon.

As a result, they changed their habitat, settling in urban areas and becoming nocturnal - which gave it an additional <a href=# title="Dark (type)">Dark</a> type and <a href=# title="Regional form">changed its appearance</a>. Due to the new environment, Rattata and Raticate indulged themselves in richer, high-calorie foods, which made Raticate fatter and have puffier cheeks.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Alolan_Meowth_and_Persian>Alolan Meowth and Persian</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Meowth (Pokémon)">Meowth</a> were imported to Alola as a gift to royalty. Due to its pampered and luxurious lifestyle, Meowth grew greedy and selfish, becoming a pure Dark-type and changing its appearance, later becoming feral and more common in the wild after the monarchy in Alola fell and left it living on the streets. Its prideful nature continued upon evolution as a <a href=# title="Persian (Pokémon)">Persian</a> and its distinct and round face is revered by the people of Alola.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Alolan_Grimer_and_Muk>Alolan Grimer and Muk</span></h3><p>When Alola became more populated, <a href=# title="Grimer (Pokémon)">Grimer</a> were imported to deal with the garbage problem.
