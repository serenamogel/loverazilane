Her father’s name is not given, although she was reared with her two brothers.&nbsp;During an interview, Alcock described her family as very non-artistic, and she stated that art was something she felt was uniquely hers, that she had ownership over, and that she clung to as a sense of independence and something she could call her own.</p><p>She was talented at acting, therefore she was accepted at Newtown High School of the Performing Arts, but she dropped out due to her professional acting career.&nbsp;When she got to school, she had to Google agencies and ask whether they could recruit her because all of her classmates had agents. She was 13 years old at the time.</p><h2>She had no idea she was being considered for the hit show.</h2><p>She caught the acting bug at a young age while growing up in Sydney, New South Wales, with her two brothers, after playing Little Red Riding Hood (a jazzed-up version of the original fairy tale) in her elementary school.&nbsp;She remembered standing on stage, waving her hand for emphasis, and feeling euphoric, as if she wanted to feel that way for the rest of her life.&nbsp;She made her debut as a teenager in the 2014 rom-com Wonderland.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Milly-Alcock-1.jpg alt="Milly Alcock" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She was playing little roles in Australia until landing a significant role in the Foxtel series Upright and the Game of Thrones prequel, House of the Dragon.&nbsp;But she had no idea she was auditioning for the prequel when she went in. She told the Evening Standard that she received a self-tape for an unknown HBO project.&nbsp;She went to the audition with a buddy and had no idea it was for House of the Dragon because HBO had cut it from the script.</p><p>She earned a role two weeks later. Alcock stated that she received the call while cooking dinner at a friend’s house.&nbsp;She couldn’t tell anyone she was auditioning for it, so she sat outside to accept the phone call, and when her agent told her she was cast, she freaked out in the backyard and went inside to ask her friend if he had any wine.&nbsp;She then became inebriated.&nbsp;Milly Alcock appears in House of the Dragon.

Instagram is the source.</p><h2>Her Valyrian language study experience</h2><p>Alcock had to master Valyrian language with different dialect tutors for House of the Dragon.&nbsp;She described her experience learning Valyrian in a podcast. Learning Valyrian, she said, was like learning a new song in a different language.&nbsp;She would memorize the scene in English, have it printed out on a sheet, and then they would have it phonetically and with an audio recording.</p><p>She’d then say it. She had muscle memory for what she was saying, so she didn’t have to think about it. Her mouth was practically on autopilot, she admitted.&nbsp;In addition, she learned how to ride a horse. For the part, she would spend hours training horseback riding. She acknowledged putting a lot of pressure on herself, knowing she has only herself to blame if it doesn’t work.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Milly-Alcock-2.jpg alt="Milly Alcock" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What is the name of her boyfriend?</h2><p>She is not currently dating anyone. She was speculated to be dating Ari Kwasner-Catsi in 2019 after posting an Instagram photo with him.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Her net worth is $2 million as of July 2023, which she has accumulated from her acting career.</p><h2>Age</h2><p>She was born on April 11, 2000, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
