Case-in-point: It seems Nicole Franzel and Hayden Voss are dunzo after hooking up during Season 16 of <i>Big Brother</i> — that is, if Nicole's quote in <i>Big Brother </i>18, "I'm single and ready to play for myself now," is anything to go off of. But, <a href=# class=T3D>when did Nicole and Hayden break up</a>? That's a little more difficult to pinpoint.</p><p>Nicole gave no indication when she showed up as a surprise houseguest in Season 18 as to when her relationship with Hayden may have ended — she just said the aforementioned single comment and we all moved on with our lives. Thankfully, though, it's 2016, and it's totally easy to at least <i>try</i> to stalk a public figure's social media accounts for clues.</p><p>For instance: On April 25, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Nicole posted a photo on Twitter</a> featuring her, Hayden, and another friend out at what appears to be a club. They don't appear <i>too</i> couple-y, so it's not clear if perhaps they broke up and were just friends at this point, or if they were, in fact, still together.</p><p>Instagram holds even more clues. On May 23, Nicole posted a photo on Instagram of her with Hayden at the <i>Me Before You</i> premiere — and unlike the April 25 photo, they did look a bit more couple-y here. <i>Me Before You</i> is a romantic, tear-jerker of a film, something you would see with a boyfriend or girlfriend... could they have still been together in this photo?</p><p>Similarly, Hayden posted his own photo with Nicole on the same day, from the premiere:</p><p>There's no clear way to tell when they really broke up, of course — only Nicole and Hayden know exactly what happened between them — but as far as social media goes, this is the last photo of Nicole and Hayden together pre-<i>Big Brother</i> Season 18. Whether this means that they broke up right before the show, or ages ago and remained friends is not clear.</p><p>Hopefully, either way, the two did remain friends — their relationship was too adorable during Season 16 to even wonder if it's anything other than that. Hopefully, Nicole's time in Season 18 will shed more light on what went down between her and Hayden too.</p><p><i>Image: CBS</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygpdubXJlp52yr3nDoptmppmYvK2xjKGYspyVo3qjvsSaomatoGLBqbGMm6CgZZKnvLW0xKtkam5dmLy2vMueZKydlaLAbsDOZpmeZZSqu7u7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt-rx-5700-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Division 2 - The AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT &amp;amp; RX 5700 Review: Navi Renews Competition in the Midrange</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nick-hargrove-wiki-height-net-worth-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nick Hargrove- Wiki, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
