He is currently under house arrest for failing to register as a sex offender in California as law demands it.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“The Petty couple moving in would lead to appraisal value of our homes to go DOWN due to safety concerns. It would lead to children and women being a target.”</p><p>It continues: “We, the residents of Hidden Hills, must put our resident’s safety first. Don’t wait to receive a letter from the government saying a predator has moved in near you. DO NOT allow this dangerous sex offender to live near you, SHOW that you are against sex offenders in our Hidden Hills neighborhood!”</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Nicki Minaj’s husband — who is also <a class=underline-link href=#>the father of her infant son Papa Bear</a> — was convicted of first-degree attempted rape in 1995 at the age of 16. He ultimately served over four years in prison for the offense and as part of his release conditions, must register as a sex offender wherever he goes.</p><p>But in March 2020, <a class=underline-link href=#>he was arrested by United States Marshals for failing to register as a sex offender in the state of California</a>. Last July, a judge slapped him with three years’ probation and a year of home detention. He was also ordered to pay a $55,000 fine.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/06/nicki-minaj-jokes-about-forgetting-fathers-day-after-posting-throwback-with-husband-250x142.jpg alt="Nicki Minaj Jokes About Forgetting Father's Day After Posting Throwback With Husband" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Nicki Minaj Jokes About Forgetting Father's Day After Posting Throwback With Husband</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>June 19, 2023</p></a><p>Originally, Kenneth Petty was on house arrest at the couple’s massive Calabasas home, which federal prosecutors weren’t happy about. They felt the gated “affluent” community, which includes a pool, state-of-the-art music studio and luxurious backyard, wasn’t exactly a punishment. Instead, they wanted Kenneth Petty hit with 15 months in prison, five years supervised release and the $55,000 in retribution.</p><p>Meanwhile, in other Nicki Minaj news, <a class=underline-link href=#>the Queens rapper was recently the victim of some swatting</a>, after police received false reports that she was abusing her child, and that her house was on fire.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a>, law enforcement officials in Los Angeles received two separate 911 calls on June 5 — one reporting that the “Starships” rapper’s son was being abused, and another claiming that Minaj was stuck in a house fire.</p><p>However, when first responders arrived at the scene, they found nothing to substantiate the claims that came through the switchboard.</p><p>“Sources close to Nicki tell us she’s not letting this little episode slide,” TMZ reported. “We’re told she’s hired lawyers to make sure the people behind this swatting are exposed and held accountable — which could mean criminal charges down the road.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0milopubnnqutc2aoWagpaivorrDZqqesF2ks6exzZ2cq2WemraotMGoqaGnn5l6sbHToquip54%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-tony-beets-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Tony Beets Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marc-anthony-danza-net-worth-income-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marc Anthony Danza Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jody-cecchetto-net-worth-156386.html>Jody Cecchetto Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./katharine-juliet-ross-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Katharine Juliet Ross | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vanessa-blandon.html>Vanessa Blandon- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atticus-shaffer.html>Atticus Shaffer Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./christopher-abbott.html>Christopher Abbott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam.
